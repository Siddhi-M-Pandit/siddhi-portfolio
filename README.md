2. **Go to your repository** on GitHub & click on **"Settings"** (top right of the repo).  
3. Scroll down to **"Pages"** (left sidebar under "Code and Automation").  
4. Under **"Source"**, keep `"Deploy from a branch"` (default setting).  
5. Under **"Branch"**, select `"main"` (or your default branch) & `"/root"` (or the folder containing your website files) folder.  
6. Click **"Save"**.  
7. **Your website will be deployed at:** https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/

After hosting & deploying the website using above steps, to auto-deploy the website whenever you update your code:
1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub & click on the **"Actions"** tab (top right of the repo).
2. Click on the **"New Workflow"** button (left sidebar).
3. Either:
- Choose a **suggested workflow** from the available options 
- OR click on **"Set up a workflow yourself"** to create custom **"static.yml"** file. 
4. Edit the **"static.yml"** file to define your GitHub Actions workflow.
5. Click **"Commit changes"** to save and activate the workflow. Push the changes to the repository.
6. Click on the latest **"Deploy static content to GitHub Pages"** workflow in **"Actions"** tab to ensure all steps show ✅ green checkmarks.
